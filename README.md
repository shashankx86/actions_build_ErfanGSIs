## A script based on Github Actions to automatically run ErfanGSIs.
### Proceed as follows: 
- First, fork this repository.
- Next, edit the build_ErfanGSIs.yml file, and change the ROM_URL to the base package you want to do gsi (note the straight link); also change the ROM_NAME to your ROM name, and BUILD_TYPE to Aonly or AB.

- Finally, expand the Upload GSI, see the Download Link link, and visit to download.
